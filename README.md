# TODO 

- [x] read some scikit examples 

- [] copy the given images code into lab, translate into importable module
    - because of some differences in fileInput in the 3.4 interpreter, reverting back to 2.7 
    - able to run images.py as given

- [] build funcs to read and display example images

- [] move from ipynb => executables asap 

- [] start building models 
    - interactive single model
    - end-to-end, executable single model (read, process, model, predict, write)
    - consider preprocessing approaches
    - loop through default settings of [all of these](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html)
    - choose a couple to gridsearch (or similar)
    - try ensemble methods
    - some approaches in [this writeup](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/)
    - try NN, convnets?

- [] other things to try:
    - MDS / tSNE + kNN [via](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_lle_digits.html#example-manifold-plot-lle-digits-py)
    - ``metrics.confusion_matrix``
