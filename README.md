# MNIST + ``scikit-learn`` = :star2: 


*Note: this is a WIP*


This code was used for a intra-team "Kaggle"-like modeling competition on the canonical [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) handwritten digits dataset. 

All of the data processing and modeling is written in Python, and there are a couple of additional bash scripts to facilitate various pieces of the workflow. Most of this code should work out of the box with Python 2.7 on OS X and Ubuntu (an isolated environment is recommended - the requirements.txt I used is included).

Additional words about the context and my workflow are in [the article on my site](joshmontague.com).
